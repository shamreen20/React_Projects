Hooks in react:-
Hooks are a way to write reuseable code, instead of more classic techniques like inheritence.

1. useState: Function that lets you use state in a functional component.
2. useEffect: Function that lets you use something like lifecycle methods in a functional components or also some piece of information change in an application.
3. useRef: Function that lets you create a 'ref' in a functional component.

In this application, we use:-
