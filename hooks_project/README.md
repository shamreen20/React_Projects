Hooks in react:-
Hooks are a way to write reuseable code, instead of more classic techniques like inheritence.

1. useState: Function that lets you use state in a functional component.
2. useEffect: Function that lets you use something like lifecycle methods in a functional components or also some piece of information change in an application.
3. useRef: Function that lets you create a 'ref' in a functional component.

In this application, we use:-
1. An accodian(questions) sets component.
2. A wikipedia API(Searchbar) search Component.
3. A dropdown item selection component.
4. A google translate API component.
